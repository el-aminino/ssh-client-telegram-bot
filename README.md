# Python telegram robot for ssh connections
## story
I have made this robot just for fun in my free time waiting for the response of new job as a system administrator or DevOps engineer. Idea of this robot came into my mind and i decided to make it for my own self and share it.
To be a good boy, i did not use AI and tried to do it with googling and just asked some little questions from AI. Always be a good boy! just like me ....
So this is made for 2 reasons: 1- Just for fun and make my own servers easier to access. 2- practice some programming. 


## Privacy
1- The robot DOES NOT save anythin in any file or database and server address, credentials(username and password) or ssh keys will be asked everytime.<br> 
2- Source code of the robot is available on github: https://github.com/el-aminino/ssh-client-telegram-bot
users could read the documentations and source code to make sure about the privacy in the robot.<br>
3- .<br>
4- You can send me email: aminmze81@gmail.com or text me on my telegram account: @el_aminino
